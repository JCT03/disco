Integer division
================

The *integer division* or *quotient* of two numbers, written ``//``,
is the integer number of times that one thing fits into another,
disregarding any :doc:`remainder <mod>`.  Alternatively, you can think
of it as :doc:`rounding down <round>` the result of the division to an
integer.  For example, ``11 // 2`` is ``5``, because ``2`` fits into
``11`` five times (with some left over).
