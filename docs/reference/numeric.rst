Numeric types
=============

Disco has four :doc:`types <type>` representing numbers:

* :doc:`Natural numbers <natural>`, written ``N``, ``‚Ñï``, ``Nat``, or
  ``Natural``.  These represent the counting numbers 0, 1, 2,
  ... which can be added and multiplied.
* :doc:`Integers <integer>`, written ``Z``, ``‚Ñ§``, ``Int``, or
  ``Integer``, allow negative numbers such as ``-5``.  They extend the
  natural numbers with subtraction.
* :doc:`Fractional numbers <fraction>`, written ``F``, ``ùîΩ``,
  ``Frac``, or ``Fractional``, allow fractions like ``2/3``.  They
  extend the natural numbers with division.
* :doc:`Rational numbers <rational>`, written ``Q``, ``‚Ñö``, or
  ``Rational``, allow both negative and fractional numbers, such as
  ``-2/3``.

We can arrange the four numeric types in a diamond, like this:
