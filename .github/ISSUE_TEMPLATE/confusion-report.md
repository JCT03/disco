If you found something confusing---for example, the behavior of a Disco function, the wording of a Disco error message *etc.*, please report it here!  It's super helpful to learn what is confusing so that we can make Disco better and easier to understand.  This is also a good place to report something that you think might be a bug, but you're not sure if it's really a bug or just something that you are misunderstanding.
